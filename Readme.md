# Weather Dashboard
### Week 6 Homework

This homework gets weather information from the OpenWeather API.

The current temperature and humidity are displayed, along with an icon for the weather conditions.

It also displays the current UV index, which changes container color depending on how favorable it is.

At the bottom, it shows a 5 day forecast, featuring an average temperature and average humidity per day, as well as an icon for the weather conditions at the start of the day.
